Explanation:
Start: The flow diagram begins with a start node.

Input: The function receives three inputs: 
base_price, quantity, and loyalty_level.

Calculate Base Total: The base total is computed by multiplying 
base_price by quantity.

Determine Discount Rate:
The discount rate is set based on the 
loyalty_level:
Level 3: 20%
Level 2: 10%
Default (Level 1): 5%
Apply Bulk Discount: If quantity exceeds 20, an additional 5% is added to the discount rate.

Calculate Final Price: The final price is calculated by subtracting the discount amount from the base total.

Return Final Price: The function returns the final price, converted to an integer.

End: The process concludes with an end node.
